Resume
Template: Bob Boberson

Once we have our hitlist, we'll make multiple versions

https://cvcompiler.com/ 

(Run your resume through to see what recruiters see don't pay)



recruiters spend 6 seconds to read the resume
so the summery is very important to be short and concise
to pass sniff test
put the key word like AI it not say i'm expert but i am intresting in AI

why you apply to work:
positive only
like i'm tired from working as freelancer and want to be part of an app that used by many people and with nice engineers

highlight reel

cs50 course 
150000 1% completed the course 
so we have something till now 

don't put location

we are in 100devs agency 

recent projects:
    - with real clients 
    - if there is no client build it as there is a client 
    - do not mention the code camp
    - don't name it 100Hours project use other names
    - don't snich on yourself by list other projects to make you clear you are in camp
    - brand a project creat a landing page for it
    - if it is working put the linkes to them


put another 2 other position:
so the total is three
